# IE-Challenge
In this project in IE University we had to work on finding a solution for the Africa Matters Initiative. It was a 6-month long project in which we had weekly coaching sessions or meetings with the clients in order to find the best possible solution for them. 
We started the project by understanding the issue the NGO trying to solve. We started by interviewing people connected to Africa. Moreover, we brainstormed different ideas in the team and finally, decidied to stick to the idea of creating hubs to spread awarness and empower young non-traditional leaders. 
The biggest challenge we went through was finding a mid-ground with the clients and fully understanding what they were lacking. 
We were very happy and excited about our end-result since we managed to help a community.
